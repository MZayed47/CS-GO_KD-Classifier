# CS-GO_KD-Classifier
This classification task is specifically dependent on a video dataset that includes video clips of kill and death scenes from the first-person shooting game “CS Go”. I have used the ResNet-50 model for image classification and then turn it into a more accurate video classifier by employing the rolling averaging method.

Two sample outputs while frame by frame processing is given below. The score is written in blue at the top-left corner of each frame.
